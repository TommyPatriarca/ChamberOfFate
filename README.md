**Chamber of Fate** is a thrilling 1v1 card game where you can challenge either the CPU or another player online. This isn't just a simple card game—it's a duel with your life on the line. Only the bold and strategic will survive the **Russian Roulette of Fate**.

## Gameplay

In Chamber of Fate, players compete in a high-stakes variation of blackjack:
- **Objective:** Get as close as possible to 21 without going over.
- **Loser’s Fate:** The player who loses the round must load a revolver with a number of bullets based on how close the winner was to 21.
- **Russian Roulette:** The losing player spins the revolver’s chamber and pulls the trigger once, risking one of their five lives.

### Key Mechanics:
1. **Blackjack Rounds:** Each round is a head-to-head blackjack game.
2. **Bullet Loading Rules:**
    - If the winner scores exactly 21, the loser must load **6 bullets** (a full revolver).
    - The closer the winner's score to 21, the more bullets are loaded (e.g., 20 = 5 bullets, 19 = 4 bullets, etc.).
3. **Lives:** Each player starts with 5 lives. If the chamber fires during Russian Roulette, the player loses a life. The first to lose all their lives is eliminated.

## Game Modes
- **Offline Mode:** Practice against the CPU and refine your blackjack and survival strategies.
- **Online Mode:** Face off against other players in high-stakes PvP matches.
